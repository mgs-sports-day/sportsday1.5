We then use various\n            algorithms to compile the data into neatly laid-out tables, cross-referencing each other for easy\n            navigation.\n\n            The website is styled using custom SCSS and is tested mobile-first, ensuring it works well on all screen\n            sizes. The compiled JavaScript files are arranged in highly-compressed per-page bundles, ensuring the site\n            loads quickly on phones and doesn't use up 'too much data'.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>\n            Development credits\n        </h2>\n        <p>\n            This website was developed by Theodore Tucker, Pal Kerecsenyi, and Geza Kerecsenyi, students of the\n            Manchester Grammar School, under the guidance of Mr D Millington, the Head of Computer Science.
